[Temp Monitor](https://temp-monitor.herokuapp.com/)
============

Is your temperature at the legal limit?

This is a networked temperature monitor system. 

It monitors the temperature from the inside using ethernet and wifi shields on NXP Kits.

This project includes:


*	Express JS, Node and Socket.io for server side websockets
*	[Postgress] as the database


The server expects RESTful HTTP calls to trigger saving and querying events: `<server address>/save/ID/temp`
